MSAIL Curriculum
================

Welcome to the MSAIL curriculum!

This is an accessible introduction to machine learning with emphasis on tools and applications.

Our goals will be to:
* Learn about classic algorithms, their formulation, and their use cases.
* Gain experience with widely used libraries.
* Get introduced to Kaggle competitions!

What are the meetings like?
* 1 hour working interactively through IPython notebooks
* Bring your laptops! Youâ€™ll be doing machine learning!

We use [RISE](https://github.com/damianavila/RISE) for presenting the IPython notebooks dynamically.
